Personal Portfolio Website

Creation Process
05/05/2022 - Creating a personal portfolio to showcase my projects to future employers and clients.

STYLE:
I decided that I wanted to keep a clean, structured, and sophisticated look to my website. I found a free template whose style and design I liked, but there were certain aspects that I wanted to change and alter completely, so I decided to code my own portfolio.

COLOR SCHEME:
I decided to stick with black, white, grays, and a gold accent for my color palette.
