                        <h4>Web & App Development</h4>
                        <p>I build clean, structured, and semantic code that leads to smooth and responsive finished products that can be viewed on any device.</p>

                        <p>I believe that no detail is too small to overlook. Web designs need to be visualy appealing, yet subtle and cohesive to allow the content to truly shine for the user.</p>

                        <p>Whether I'm on a team of devs or with a client, I make communication a top priority at every step of the process - discussing project timelines, updates, and any issues.</p>

                    <h3>Consultation</h3>
                    <p>Our partnership begins with a "coffee chat", where we discuss every detail of the project you are envisioning - no project idea is off-limits.</p>
                    <h3>Proposal</h3>
                    <p>After we discuss your project, I will follow up with a proposal. This is where I compile all of your ideas. My job is to ensure I can deliver a finished product within a reasonable timeframe and within your desired budget, all while meeting your needs.</p>
                    <h3>Creation</h3>
                    <p>From this point, I will begin developing your website or app. I will contact you with regular updates on what I'm working on. During this process, you will have ample time to interact and experience the product to ensure your satisfaction.</p>
                    <h3>Rollout</h3>
                    <p>Once the product is finished, it will be transported to its destination. You can rest assured knowing that I will overlook that process and offer the support you need if any issues arise.</p>
